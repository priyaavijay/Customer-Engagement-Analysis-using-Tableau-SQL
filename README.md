# **Overview**

This project is a guided case study from the Customer Engagement Analysis with SQL & Tableau course by 365 Data Science. It explores customer behavior, engagement patterns, and business insights using SQL and Tableau for data-driven decision-making.

# **Objectives**

Analyze customer engagement trends based on historical data.

Identify key drivers of customer retention and churn.

Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

Provide actionable insights to improve customer experience and business growth.

# **Data Sources**

The dataset consists of:

Customer demographics and behavioral data.

Transactional data including purchase history.

Customer interaction logs from various platforms (e.g., website, mobile app, customer support).

Marketing campaign performance metrics.

# **Technology Stack**

Data Processing: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization & Reporting: Tableau

Database Management: SQL-based data extraction and manipulation
#**Data Analysis Insights & Results**

# **Platform Engagement**

Over 19,000 students have engaged with the platform's content.

Engagement grew from 100 daily students in January to 400 in October.

Free plan students converting to paid subscriptions caused overlap in engagement counts.

The last three months saw the highest engagement levels.

# **Onboarding & Retention**

Onboarding rate varied between 40-60%, increasing to 70% post-September platform updates.

A recommended strategy: monthly retargeting of recent registrants via paid ads to boost engagement and conversions.

50% of paying students remain after one month, with 40% retention in period two, stabilizing at 30% long-term engagement.

Higher new subscriber counts in January, March, July, and September coincide with marketing campaigns.

Analysis of past cohorts shows returning students engaging with the new gamified platform, boosting retention rates.

Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate (F2P CR) & Subscription Duration

3% of registered users convert to paid plans (~560 students).

Higher conversion rates observed in students watching at least 2 hours of content (~40% success rate in key buckets).

Students with 40-50 minutes of watched content show a consistent conversion trend.

Courses leading to higher conversions should be highlighted to new free-plan users.

# **Proposed strategies:**

Implement a quiz-based recommendation system to help students find relevant courses.

A/B test a 24-hour free access window to increase engagement and conversion.

Longer watched durations correlate with longer subscription periods, reinforcing the importance of engaging users early.
